# Joint cumulants and connected correlators

Joint cumulants are defined by the Möbius transform of block moments.  The finite-partition layer
therefore contains all combinatorial coefficients, while this file only supplies probability and
integrability hypotheses.

Deferred proof references:

* G.-C. Rota, Möbius inversion: <https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00531932>.
* Mathlib's analytic MGF theorem:
  <https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4/blob/abb22825db7e020c94f38a007ae3fffe6c3a7532/Mathlib/Probability/Moments/MGFAnalytic.lean>.

Each deferred theorem includes an informal proof specialized to its statement.

variable {Ω ι κ : Type*} [MeasurableSpace Ω] {μ : Measure Ω}

/-- The cumulant associated with a block of positions.  The Möbius transform makes sense for an
arbitrary measure; probability normalization is imposed only by the theorems that need it. -/
def blockCumulant [DecidableEq ι] (μ : Measure Ω)
    (X : ι → Ω → ℝ) (B : Finset ι) : ℝ :=
  Finpartition.cumulantTransform (blockMoment μ X) B

/-- The joint cumulant, or connected correlator, of a finite family of observables. -/
def jointCumulant [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι] (μ : Measure Ω) (X : ι → Ω → ℝ) : ℝ :=
  blockCumulant μ X Finset.univ

/-- The zeroth joint cumulant is zero.

Informal proof: `jointCumulant` evaluates `cumulantTransform` on the empty set, where its defining
convention is zero. -/
@[simp]
theorem jointCumulant_zero [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (X : Fin 0 → Ω → ℝ) :
    jointCumulant μ X = 0 := by
  simp [jointCumulant, blockCumulant, Finpartition.cumulantTransform]

/-- A block cumulant is the joint cumulant of the family restricted to that block.

Informal proof: reindex subsets of `B` by the equivalence between finsets of the subtype `B` and
subsets of `B`, then apply `Finpartition.cumulantTransform_map`. -/
theorem blockCumulant_eq_jointCumulant_subtype [DecidableEq ι] [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]
    (X : ι → Ω → ℝ) (B : Finset ι) :
    blockCumulant μ X B = jointCumulant μ (fun i : B ↦ X i.1) := by
  sorry

/-- A joint moment is the sum over partitions of products of connected correlators.

Informal proof: apply `Finpartition.partitionTransform_cumulantTransform` to the block-moment
function.  Its empty value is one by the probability-measure assumption; rewrite each block
cumulant with `blockCumulant_eq_jointCumulant_subtype`.  No partition is enumerated. -/
theorem jointMoment_eq_sum_partition_jointCumulant [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι]
    [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (X : ι → Ω → ℝ) :
    jointMoment μ X =
      ∑ P : Finpartition (Finset.univ : Finset ι),
        ∏ B ∈ P.parts, jointCumulant μ (fun i : B ↦ X i.1) := by
  sorry

/-- The first cumulant is the expectation.

Informal proof: the only partition of a singleton has one block, whose Möbius coefficient is one. -/
theorem jointCumulant_one [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (X : Fin 1 → Ω → ℝ) :
    jointCumulant μ X = ∫ ω, X 0 ω ∂μ := by
  sorry

/-- The second cumulant is the second moment minus the product of the means.

Informal proof: the two partitions of two positions are the indiscrete partition and the partition
into singletons.  Their Möbius coefficients are `1` and `-1`; this can be obtained by specializing
the generic partition transform rather than expanding later probability proofs. -/
theorem jointCumulant_two [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (X : Fin 2 → Ω → ℝ) :
    jointCumulant μ X =
      (∫ ω, X 0 ω * X 1 ω ∂μ) - (∫ ω, X 0 ω ∂μ) * ∫ ω, X 1 ω ∂μ := by
  sorry

/-- Under square-integrability, the second cumulant is Mathlib's covariance.

Informal proof: combine `jointCumulant_two` with `ProbabilityTheory.covariance_eq_sub`. -/
theorem jointCumulant_two_eq_covariance [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (X : Fin 2 → Ω → ℝ)
    (h0 : MemLp (X 0) 2 μ) (h1 : MemLp (X 1) 2 μ) :
    jointCumulant μ X = covariance (X 0) (X 1) μ := by
  sorry

/-- Exact centered fourth-cumulant formula.

Informal proof: specialize the generic Möbius formula to four positions.  Every partition with a
singleton block vanishes by `hcenter`; the remaining partitions are the one four-element block and
the three partitions into two pairs.  The classification should be proved once as a finite-
partition lemma, not by enumerating terms in this probability theorem. -/
theorem jointCumulant_four_of_centered [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (X : Fin 4 → Ω → ℝ)
    (hcenter : ∀ i, ∫ ω, X i ω ∂μ = 0) :
    jointCumulant μ X =
      (∫ ω, X 0 ω * X 1 ω * X 2 ω * X 3 ω ∂μ)
        - (∫ ω, X 0 ω * X 1 ω ∂μ) * (∫ ω, X 2 ω * X 3 ω ∂μ)
        - (∫ ω, X 0 ω * X 2 ω ∂μ) * (∫ ω, X 1 ω * X 3 ω ∂μ)
        - (∫ ω, X 0 ω * X 3 ω ∂μ) * (∫ ω, X 1 ω * X 2 ω ∂μ) := by
  sorry

/-- Joint cumulants are invariant under equivalences of their position types.

Informal proof: use `Finpartition.cumulantTransform_map` and `jointMoment_perm` on every block. -/
theorem jointCumulant_perm [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι] [Fintype κ] [DecidableEq κ]
    [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (e : ι ≃ κ) (X : ι → Ω → ℝ) :
    jointCumulant μ (fun j ↦ X (e.symm j)) = jointCumulant μ X := by
  sorry

/-- Joint cumulants are additive in one argument when all needed moments are integrable.

Informal proof: split each block moment containing `i` with integral additivity, then distribute
through the finite Möbius sum.  Blocks not containing `i` occur identically on both sides and their
coefficients cancel by the same partition identity. -/
theorem jointCumulant_add [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι] [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]
    (X : ι → Ω → ℝ) (i : ι) (Y : Ω → ℝ)
    (hX : HasFiniteJointMoments μ X)
    (hY : HasFiniteJointMoments μ (Function.update X i Y)) :
    jointCumulant μ (Function.update X i (X i + Y)) =
      jointCumulant μ X + jointCumulant μ (Function.update X i Y) := by
  sorry

/-- Joint cumulants are homogeneous in one argument.

Informal proof: every block containing `i` acquires one factor `c`; finite integral and product
linearity pull that factor through the Möbius sum. -/
theorem jointCumulant_smul [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι] [IsProbabilityMeasure μ]
    (X : ι → Ω → ℝ) (i : ι) (c : ℝ) :
    jointCumulant μ (Function.update X i (c • X i)) = c * jointCumulant μ X := by
  sorry

/-- Independence of the observables indexed by `A` from those indexed by its complement. -/
def IndepAcross [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι] (μ : Measure Ω) (X : ι → Ω → ℝ)
    (A : Finset ι) : Prop :=
  IndepFun (fun ω (i : A) ↦ X i.1 ω) (fun ω (i : {i : ι // i ∉ A}) ↦ X i.1 ω) μ

/-- A joint cumulant vanishes when its positions split into two nonempty independent blocks.

Informal proof: independence factors every mixed block moment into its two restrictions.  Insert
those factorizations into the Möbius formula; Möbius inversion on the product of the two partition
lattices makes the total coefficient zero. -/
theorem jointCumulant_eq_zero_of_indepFun_split [Fintype ι] [DecidableEq ι]
    [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (X : ι → Ω → ℝ) (A : Finset ι)
    (hA : A.Nonempty) (hAc : (Finset.univ \ A).Nonempty)
    (hX : HasFiniteJointMoments μ X) (hmeas : ∀ i, Measurable (X i))
    (hindep : IndepAcross μ X A) :
    jointCumulant μ X = 0 := by
  sorry

/-- The scalar cumulant is the derivative of the cumulant-generating function at zero. -/
def cumulant (μ : Measure Ω) (X : Ω → ℝ) (n : ℕ) : ℝ :=
  iteratedDeriv n (cgf X μ) 0

/-- Analytic and set-partition definitions of a repeated-variable cumulant agree.

Informal proof: `iteratedDeriv_mgf_zero` identifies the MGF coefficients with moments.  Expanding
the logarithm of a power series with constant coefficient one gives the partition-lattice Möbius
coefficients, so the `n`th CGF derivative is exactly the joint cumulant of `n` copies of `X`. -/
theorem cumulant_eq_jointCumulant [IsProbabilityMeasure μ] (X : Ω → ℝ) (n : ℕ)
    (hmgf : 0 ∈ interior (integrableExpSet X μ)) :
    cumulant μ X n = jointCumulant μ (fun _ : Fin n ↦ X) := by
